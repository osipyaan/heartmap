      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">imagine this:</h2>
      <p>you’ve just survived a heart attack. you’re told to “rest,” but your heart skips, stalls, and you’re scared. you’re 50, and already being fitted for a defibrillator. no one mentions recovery. just risk. meanwhile, the technology exists — but not for you.</p>
      <p>1 in 4 cardiac patients experience a second major event within 5 years. cardiac patches exist, but they’re often one-size-fits-all — failing to match the rhythm of your actual heart.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">the problem: engineered patches fail to integrate electrically</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li>placement is imprecise, based on guesswork. Inaccurate placement of electrodes can significantly affect the morphology of ECG waveforms, potentially leading to misinterpretation of cardiac rhythms. This underscores the importance of precise placement to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</li>
        <li>electrical mismatch leads to arrhythmias. Studies have shown that spatial profiles of electrical mismatch can determine vulnerability to reentrant arrhythmias. This highlights the critical need for electrical compatibility between the patch and the host tissue to prevent adverse outcomes. </li>
        <li>post-MI hearts vary widely — but patches don’t. After a myocardial infarction (MI), the heart undergoes complex remodeling, resulting in heterogeneous tissue characteristics that are not adequately addressed by standardized patches (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences).</li>
        <li>iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) often exhibit immature electrical properties, leading to poor integration with native cardiac tissue.</li>
      </ul>
